### SOBRE 

Greetings! ðŸ‘‹

Passage through the Brazilian Army in 2011 at Academia Militar das Agulhas Negras (AMAN), where I had a lot of contact with leadership, teamwork, people management, discipline, organization, communication, proactivity and dealing with pressure. I was highlighted in the platoon and signed the book of honor for completing the year without any punishment.

I graduated in mechanical engineering at Universidade de BrasÃ­lia (UnB), where I had a lot of technical knowledge, but mainly, calculus, statistics and how to learn any skill. I graduated in 2018, without failing any subject, and with academic performance (IRA) above 4 (of 5).

I carried out scientific initiation in a project in collaboration with the Federal Police that gave me a lot of knowledge about scientific methodology, documents and spreadsheets.

Passage through the junior company of mechanical engineering at UnB (TECMEC), where I had contact with project management, entrepreneurship and notions of marketing and administration. Trainee highlighted in the 2014 selection process, promoted to HR director and receiving the award for best director by employee voting.

After graduating, I followed the path of public tenders, doing a postgraduate course in public security, where I acquired a good notion of the functioning of the State, politics and public administration. Approved in the 2021 Federal Police contest.

Today, I no longer intend to link my career and success to the Brazilian State, which is why I am migrating to the IT area and looking for a position as a junior developer. I have knowledge of the python programming language, Django framework for backend, MySQL database, use of Git and GitHub and others.
